## Keyboard-Only Workflow

With the right shortcuts, you can use Phoenix without ever touching the mouse:

1. Select code with keyboard navigation (`Shift+Arrow` keys)
2. Send to Phoenix with `Ctrl+'` / `Cmd+'`
3. Type your question and press Enter
4. Review the response and apply suggestions

## Editor Integration Shortcuts

Phoenix's keyboard shortcuts integrate seamlessly with VSCode's built-in shortcuts:

-   Use VSCode's selection shortcuts (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to select line, etc.) before sending code to Phoenix
-   Combine with VSCode's split editor shortcuts to view code and Phoenix side by side
-   Use VSCode's terminal focus shortcut (`` Ctrl+` `` / `` Cmd+` ``) before capturing terminal output

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Learn the default shortcut first**: The `Ctrl+'` / `Cmd+'` shortcut is versatile - it adds selected code to chat when text is selected, or focuses the chat input when nothing is selected
-   **Create muscle memory**: Use keyboard shortcuts consistently to build habits
-   **Customize for your workflow**: Assign shortcuts to commands you use frequently
-   **Consider ergonomics**: Choose shortcuts that are comfortable for your keyboard layout

Keyboard shortcuts may seem like a small optimization, but they can significantly speed up your workflow when using Phoenix regularly. By keeping your hands on the keyboard, you maintain your coding flow while still getting AI assistance exactly when you need it.
